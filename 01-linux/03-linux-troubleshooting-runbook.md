# Day 05 – Linux Troubleshooting Drill: CPU, Memory, and Logs (Environment: KillerCoda Ubuntu 24.04 playground)

## Target service / process
- `systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running`: Filters and lists down the real-time service units which are currently running in your Linux system.
- Snapshot:

- We'll choose 'ssh' service here to work on.

## Snapshot: CPU & Memory
### 1. Service status:
- `sudo systemctl status ssh`: To check the current status of 'ssh' service.
- Snapshot:

### 2. CPU & Memory:
- `ps aux | grep sshd`: Filter the process which is running 'ssh' and check its CPU and memory usage.
- `free -h`: To check the free space in human-readable format.
- Snapshot:

## Snapshot: Disk & IO
- `df -h`: To check the disk usage.
- `iostat -x 1 3`: Monitors and displays extended disk (I/O) statistics on your system, taking 3 total samples spaced exactly 1 second apart.
- Snapshot:

## Snapshot: Network
- `ss -tlnp | grep ssh`: Checks if SSH server is actively listening for incoming network connections on your Linux system and displays the process details.
- Snapshot:

## Logs reviewed
- `sudo journalctl -u ssh -n 50`:

- `sudo journalctl -u ssh -p err -n 20`:
- Snapshot:

## Quick findings

1. Service status:
   - 'ssh' service is disabled on boot which means it won't auto-start on reboot.
2. CPU & Memory:
   - sshd is consuming negligible CPU (0.0%) and memory (0.4%). RAM is healthy with 1.5GB available.
3. Disk & IO:
   - Disk space is healthy. No IO bottleneck.
4. Network:
   - sshd is correctly listening on port 22 for both IPv4 and IPv6. No anomalies.
5. Logs:
   - Two identical errors showed up: `root : unable to resolve host vm2: Name or service not known` for two different PIDs (1357 and 1359).
   - sudo error, not sshd. It showed up in SSH logs because sudo was runned in the ssh session. 

## If this worsens (next steps)

1. Service status:
   - If 'sshd' stops responding, run `sudo systemctl enable ssh` before any planned or unplanned reboot.
2. CPU & Memory:
   - IF there's high memory usage by 'sshd', run `ps aux --sort=-%mem`.
3. Disk & IO:
   - If disk is full causing SSH log failures, run `df -h` and clear logs with `sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2d`
4. Network:
   - IF port 22 is not in this list at all, run `sudo systemctl restart ssh`.
5. Logs:
   - Low priority.
